      March 14 and 15 something spectacular happened. In less than 6 hours
      AccelerateEstonia and Garage48 put together an online hackathon to tackle
      the effects of the Coronavirus crisis. More than a thousand people across
      14 time zones joined, and out of the 30 or so ideas, several are already
      up and running!


      The world took notice. Now there are almost 30 initiatives around the
      globe hacking away, from India to Georgia to Brazil. There’s been a
      massive ripple effect (exponential growth, if you pardon the
      epidemiological parlance), which proves that if there ever was a time to
      make things bigger, then this is it!

      We need to start solving the problems that we’ll face as a global society,
      once we venture out from our homes again. How will we deal with the
      changed relationships in the economy, the future of work, healthcare and a
      world transformed, perhaps, beyond recognition? Maybe we’ll even come up
      with solutions to fight future pandemics more effectively.


      To create solutions we’re putting on The Global Hack on April 3-5. 


      We’re expecting brilliant people from every corner of the world to
      participate in an online hackathon. We are also looking for mentors and
      inspirational global leaders to support our mission and dedicate their
      time and expertise over the weekend. 


      We’re in a unique situation and we literally are in it all together: the
      whole world is looking for solutions to the same problems at the same
      time.
