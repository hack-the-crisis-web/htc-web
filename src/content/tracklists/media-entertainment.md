      The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness and understanding of the
      interconnectedness across sectors, regions and generations with specific
      focus on health, economic development, environment and on social
      inclusion. All those topics are contained in [The 2030 Agenda for
      Sustainable
      Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld),
      agreed upon by all governments in 2015 with a shared vision of improving
      the lives of people everywhere, whilst protecting our planet. The agenda
      commits to the essentials that every human being needs, now and in the
      future, from health to decent work to clean air to reliable institutions.
      This agenda contains [17 measurable Sustainable Development
      Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/) to be achieved by 2030.
      Five years into the 2030 Agenda, we still need actions, creativity and
      champions to scale up awareness and involvement of people on the
      Sustainable Development Goals. How can we best leverage multimedia formats
      and opportunities in offline or online channels to increase awareness of
      the Sustainable Development Goals and even more importantly accelerate
      action towards their achievement?Lastly, how can we leverage this time of
      crises to put in motion behavioural shifts that can be sustained beyond
      the crises?

## **Why Media & Entertainment?**

**This is the first pandemic of the information age. The outbreak has coincided with a period in which the internet is rapidly changing the way we consume information and connect with each other, both for better and for worse. We can all more easily create and share our own content, which creates new opportunities but also new dangers. People will now be spending even more time online consuming content, but people risk being misled, shut off from information, and radicalised into extreme views. How can we instead collectively emerge into a better informed and more transparent world?**
