            Though the total usage of internet-streaming services has surged by
            between 50% and 70%, starting from January 2020, most of the popular
            platforms are still hard to monetize as they do not offer pay per
            view option and their links are easily sharable.

            Pandemic made travel almost impossible, and for people from risk
            groups, such as 50+, it will probably be still hard to travel for an
            extended period of time even after the situation normalizes. As a
            tourism expert, I expect that tourism activities have a dramatic
            decrease on the long run.

            communities that are larger than 5 and smaller than 25. That is, we

            more organically.

            With lockdown, the performing arts are suffering from the lack of
            direct contact and "energy transfer" between performers and
            audience. We are creating a platform where audience is visible to
            the artist and to each-other, much like on the real venue at the
            event or festival, by turning their webcams on and allowing
            elektron.live capture the pictures of the spectators.

            Art is fundamental in the daily life, yet it became kind of luxury
            being sold by galleries. It is not widely accessible as it could be.
            Young artists on the other hand struggle with getting presented by
            galleries, so they have to promote their art with Instagram and
            other socials. There is no way people can "try" the art before
            buying it.

            the spread, treatments of Covid-19 which is potentially more harmful
            than the virus itself. There have been so many cases of needless

            We built and integrated UV lamps to our existing robot,the uv lamps
            work using AC power supply, so we managed to hack into the UPS used
            in computers and created a power supply that can take DC supply from
            the Robot and convert it into AC Supply required for uv lamps, we
            also created a UI in which the UV lamp can be enabled remotely, as

            Victims of Novel Corona virus develop acute respiratory failure and
            requires support of mechanical ventilation. Ventilators are highly
            expensive of about 4-5 lakhs. Conventional BVM bag compression which
            is low cost causes barotrauma, rupture of alveoli. The remote rural
            areas across the world are inaccessible to healthcare. Our idea is
            to create Low-cost, portable ventilator based on air-turbine for
            mass casualty cases with estimated cost of 10K Rs.

            As an idea to solve this problem, we worked creatively to innovate a
            Social Distancing Supervision System. We implied in our solution
            video processing to spot crowd density. An input real-life video is
            intoduced to our application from a crowded place to analyze and
            report the measured distance status between individuals. As a
            result, a real life feed of the camera with all neeeded distance
            calcultations is provided to the superviser. Add to that, we started
            representing our data in a web dashboard that we will make more
            interractive in the future.

            During the hack we have reached the full "CPAP" breathing support
            solution together with the monitoring system.


            Also we built an subjective feeling feedback app that hospitals will
            now be testing to utilise to remote-monitor the risk-group patients.
            And managed to build a platform where you can donate your CPAP
            breathing aid machine for the hospitals.

            medical and transportation system of a country and maintains the
            privacy of the users. It informs the medical system accurately about
            the spread of infection. It also helps the authorities to make sure
            if a person who is tested positive stays in his/her quarantined
            location. It provides a dashboard for all to see which places may be
            infected.

            When disaster strikes, it is common for a hospital or even a city to
            quickly become overwhelmed with patients, whereas the neighboring
            regions might have capacity. Even if the infrastructure and
            transport capacities are sufficient, the coordination is often very
            poor. The capability to build a detailed plan in advance would allow
            the load to be evenly distributed across a number of facilities,
            resulting in better individual care for the patients.

            provide the required solutions. This app should bring about a sense

            during any crisis and come out on top.

            There are 3 billion of us in lockdown, yet we still need to go
            shopping, to the pharmacy or to work. The WHO and CDC claim that
            lack of social distancing is the main reason the virus spreads. Not
            knowing where crowded areas are when going out, or queuing in front
            of stores and pharmacies for a long time make proper social
            distancing impossible.

            All around the world, millions of people have gone into mandatory
            quarantine. Transit and attention restrictions make it hard for us
            to do any daily shopping. That means that if anyone runs out of an
            essential item such as soap or aspirins, they have no way of getting
            them in a timely manner. Can you imagine running out of toilet
            paper?
