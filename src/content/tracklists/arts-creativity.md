## **Why Arts & Creativity?**

Arts in its many different forms from music to theatre and from films to video-gaming and comedy is essential for helping us find purpose, beauty and comfort in life. Arts & creativity do not just enlighten and entertain us but help us process life around us. Looking deeper, we find that arts and creativity also form the pillars of our economy and competitive edge.

As concert halls, theatres, museums and libraries around the world go dark and thousands of gigs, festivals, exhibitions, conferences, galas and sports games have been cancelled or postponed, we need to ensure that we will have this vibrant cultural life to go back to. It’s not a luxury but a public good that also keeps cities and communities alive, draws tourists and business and provides a playfield for self-expression and innovation.

No one knows when life returns to normal for the creators, companies and organisations in the sector, furthermore, it’s hard to tell what the “new normal” will be. For the time being, the activities, income streams and funding have been strained. It is time to upgrade the sector’s capacity to innovate - not only by temporary solutions to overcome a few months but by strengthening the groundwork and rebuilding business models for a more sustainable future.
