      Hackathon is an intense brainstorming marathon where people with different
      skills get together, exchange ideas, form teams around the best ideas and
      develop working prototypes over the course of 48 hours. The brainstorming
      sessions are well structured and the teams are helped throughout the
      weekend by world-class mentors.
