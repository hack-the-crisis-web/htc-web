  The Global Hack is an online hackathon designed to share and rapidly develop
  ideas for urgently needed solutions in the face of the current crisis, as well
  as to build resilience post-pandemic.

  The Global Hack has already drawn attention across the globe - covered by
  Forbes, Silicon Republic, GovInsider among others - and brought on board a
  fleet of world-class mentors, such as Silicon Valley’s tech superstar Steve
  Jurvetson and former President of Estonia and a visiting fellow at Stanford -
  Toomas Hendrik Ilves.

  The tracks are inspired by the UN sustainability goals that cover the majority
  of our future challenges. These are the areas most likely to see the biggest
  changes:

      On 13–15 March something spectacular started in Estonia. It took fewer
      than six hours for AccelerateEstonia, Garage48, and Guaana to put together
      an online hackathon to tackle the devastating effects of the Coronavirus
      crisis. 


      More than 1200 people across 14 time zones joined this effort and the
      world took notice. Now there are almost 40+  initiatives around the globe
      hacking away, from India to Georgia to Brazil. Hackathons all around the
      globe are reaching more than 200,000 participants.

      How will we deal with the changed relationships in the economy, the future
      of work, healthcare and a world transformed, perhaps, beyond recognition? 


      We need to come up with solutions that will help us fight future
      pandemics, and all crises for that matter, more effectively. So we never
      have to lock down again.
