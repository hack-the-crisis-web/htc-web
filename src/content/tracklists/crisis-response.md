## Why Crisis Response?

Medical workers and other emergency response personnel will be on the frontline of this pandemic, although many others will be working behind the scenes to support them, and every single person has a duty to help them by preventing the spread of the virus.

This is not a drill, but it will test us all to the extreme. How do we help those who help us and what lessons can we all take forward for the next crisis?
