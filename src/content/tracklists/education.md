      Starting next school year, Latvian schools will be implementing a newly
      developed curriculum, emphasizing meaningful learning, lifelong learning
      skills. This means greater emphasis on clear learning goals for students,
      timely and developmental feedback, self-monitoring and reflection on what
      is being learned and what must be improved. Latvian schools - pupils and
      teachers - need a set of integrated tools, where teachers can monitor
      student progress against clear learning goals, students can follow their
      own growth and submit evidence of learning, students of different ages and
      stages can create portfolios of their work, reflect on it, select their
      best pieces, choose to make them visible to peers and teachers for
      feedback, in other words - simple, straightforward tools that help make
      learning visible to everyone involved.

## Why Education?

Few things have had a more powerfully positive impact on our planet than improved access to education. However, classrooms around the world have suddenly been locked shut and teachers are urgently rethinking how to teach effectively.

The impact of this ranges from slight inconvenience in digitally connected countries to complete interruption of education in many other parts of the world. There are also many challenging consequences, including an increase in hunger among pupils who depended on school meals and an added burden on parents.

Countries like Estonia have shown that the technology for e-schooling works through the crisis, but it still has room for improvement and any improvements we can find to help pupils learn now could become the new normal for better education in future.
