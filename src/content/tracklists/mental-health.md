A sudden change in circumstances can be mentally challenging, whether it’s losing a loved one, a job or even just political upheaval. All these factors combine in this crisis in ways that most of us have never seen during our lifetimes. In addition, relationships will be put under considerable pressure and many will be lonelier than ever before, which is one of the most significant contributing factors to ill mental health.

However, it’s ok not to be ok at any time, not just during this crisis, and this affects all of us. Mental health challenges are far less visible than physical health challenges, but they are just as important and just as deserving of solutions. If we can surge healthcare capacity to fight the virus then how can we make a similar effort to improve mental health.
