  The Global Hack is an online hackathon designed to share and rapidly develop
  ideas for urgently needed solutions in the face of the current crisis, as well
  as to build resilience post-pandemic.


  Our prize pool for the best ideas is 195k euros. 


  The Global Hack has already drawn attention across the globe - covered by
  Forbes, Silicon Republic, CNN among others - and brought on board a fleet of
  world-class mentors, such as Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, former President of
  Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Khaliya -  public health specialist and a
  neuro-technologist.
tracklistDescription: >-
  The tracks are inspired by the UN sustainability goals that cover the majority
  of our future challenges. These are the areas most likely to see the biggest
  challenges.
