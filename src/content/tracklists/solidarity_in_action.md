      To develop specific actions that need to be taken at the EU-level to
      protect the health, well-being and livelihoods of citizens. These actions
      will include activities focused on support measures to protect citizen's
      jobs and income; ensuring the stable supply of protective equipment and
      medicine across Europe and solutions to ensure the continuous supply of
      basic goods and food across EU borders.

      Now more than ever, we need greater collaboration to scale up local and
      digital solutions. This is the time to connect people with a passion for
      making a difference in tackling the most challenging issues that our
      communities face. This is the time to also connect actions taken by people
      across the world for greater impact and share the inspiring stories of the
      ordinary heroes who are driving change.\

      The challenge is to formulate a solution that can bring together action
      campaigns - from the United Nations system and other institutional
      partners - with everyone who is inspired to take action, from civil
      society organizations to artists, social innovators and governments, to
      generate meaningful change for a better world.\

      How do we harness the momentum for good that has emerged from the crisis
      to inspire and build a growing global community of people eager to take
      action, to help them learn about the ways they can contribute and connect
      with people, entities and resources they need?

This moment is a historic opportunity for all of us. People have the power to change the world. We urgently need creative and scalable solutions that harness the positive power of solidarity and coordinated action to tackle this global challenge together and maintain this momentum beyond the crisis.

Inspiring acts of solidarity are sweeping the planet, ranging from people clapping hands for health workers from their balconies and windows, to people sewing face masks or distributing food to the elderly and most vulnerable.Millions of people, in lockdown around the world, have the will and the collective power to boost a global solidarity movement that will be able - once the health crisis is over - to address the key challenges faced by people and the planet.

This is the time to generate individual actions people can take and ways in which those actions can be connected for greater impact.
