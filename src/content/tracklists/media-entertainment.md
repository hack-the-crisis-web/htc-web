**This is the first pandemic of the information age. The outbreak has coincided with a period in which the internet is rapidly changing the way we consume information and connect with each other, both for better and for worse. We can all more easily create and share our own content, which creates new opportunities but also new dangers. People will now be spending even more time online consuming content, but people risk being misled, shut off from information, and radicalised into extreme views. How can we instead collectively emerge into a better informed and more transparent world?**
