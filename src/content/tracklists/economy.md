## Why economy?

We are facing a severe economic crisis like no other as traditional methods for stimulating the economy don’t work under lockdown. This is already having immediate economic consequences as we do not know how long this crisis will last and the impact is expected to last for a considerable time after that too.

Yet an economic crisis can give birth to successful companies, while a national crisis can result in a completely new economic order for the better. We should expect the global economy to be very different after this global crisis so how should we start adapting for this now?
