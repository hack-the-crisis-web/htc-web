            Though the total usage of internet-streaming services has surged by
            between 50% and 70%, starting from January 2020, most of the popular
            platforms are still hard to monetize as they do not offer pay per
            view option and their links are easily sharable.

            Pandemic made travel almost impossible, and for people from risk
            groups, such as 50+, it will probably be still hard to travel for an
            extended period of time even after the situation normalizes. As a
            tourism expert, I expect that tourism activities have a dramatic

            With lockdown, the performing arts are suffering from the lack of
            direct contact and "energy transfer" between performers and
            audience. We are creating a platform where audience is visible to
            the artist and to each-other, much like on the real venue at the
            event or festival, by turning their webcams on and allowing
            elektron.live capture the pictures of the spectators.

            Art is fundamental in the daily life, yet it became kind of luxury
            being sold by galleries. It is not widely accessible as it could be.
            Young artists on the other hand struggle with getting presented by
            galleries, so they have to promote their art with Instagram and
            other socials. There is no way people can "try" the art before
            buying it.

            Victims of Novel Corona virus develop acute respiratory failure and
            requires support of mechanical ventilation. Ventilators are highly
            expensive of about 4-5 lakhs. Conventional BVM bag compression which
            is low cost causes barotrauma, rupture of alveoli. The remote rural
            areas across the world are inaccessible to healthcare. Our idea is
            to create Low-cost, portable ventilator based on air-turbine for
            mass casualty cases with estimated cost of 10K Rs.

            As an idea to solve this problem, we worked creatively to innovate a
            Social Distancing Supervision System. We implied in our solution
            video processing to spot crowd density. An input real-life video is
            intoduced to our application from a crowded place to analyze and
            report the measured distance status between individuals. As a
            result, a real life feed of the camera with all neeeded distance
            calcultations is provided to the superviser. Add to that, we started
            representing our data in a web dashboard that we will make more
            interractive in the future.

            When disaster strikes, it is common for a hospital or even a city to
            quickly become overwhelmed with patients, whereas the neighboring
            regions might have capacity. Even if the infrastructure and
            transport capacities are sufficient, the coordination is often very
            poor. The capability to build a detailed plan in advance would allow
            the load to be evenly distributed across a number of facilities,
            resulting in better individual care for the patients.

            There are 3 billion of us in lockdown, yet we still need to go
            shopping, to the pharmacy or to work. The WHO and CDC claim that

            knowing where crowded areas are when going out, or queuing in front
