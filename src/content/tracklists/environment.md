## **Why Environment?**

**Before this coronavirus crisis began, our planet was already in a climate crisis â€“ although with less consensus about the urgency of the issue and less cooperation aimed at solving it.**

**Now, measures to combat coronavirus have unintentionally helped our environment as pollution has reduced dramatically. Will our planet return to its previous ways after this crisis or will we discover a new appreciation for our temporarily cleaner world, as well as new ideas to work together to clean it up even more?**
