      Many of the arts and creative sector players have not yet fully embraced
      the era of digitalisation. Now we are forced to do so. While live streams
      of music and theatre performances, as well as gallery excursions, are
      taking place, we think the real innovation is still yet to emerge. How to
      find your way down the digital path in constant information overload and
      the abundance of available options? How to monetize the digital presence
      by developing the activities into new business opportunities? How to make
      your creative brand relevant on the global scale, now that it has reached
      online? Out of uncertainty, discomfort and reevaluation we hope to build a
      more sustainable future and upgrade the role of Arts & Creativity in the
      society.

## **Why Arts & Creativity?**

Arts in its many different forms from music to theatre and from films to video-gaming and comedy is essential for helping us find purpose, beauty and comfort in life. Arts & creativity do not just enlighten and entertain us but help us process life around us. Looking deeper, we find that arts and creativity also form the pillars of our economy and competitive edge.

As concert halls, theatres, museums and libraries around the world go dark and thousands of gigs, festivals, exhibitions, conferences, galas and sports games have been cancelled or postponed, we need to ensure that we will have this vibrant cultural life to go back to. It’s not a luxury but a public good that also keeps cities and communities alive, draws tourists and business and provides a playfield for self-expression and innovation.

No one knows when life returns to normal for the creators, companies and organisations in the sector, furthermore, it’s hard to tell what the “new normal” will be. For the time being, the activities, income streams and funding have been strained. It is time to upgrade the sector’s capacity to innovate - not only by temporary solutions to overcome a few months but by strengthening the groundwork and rebuilding business models for a more sustainable future.
