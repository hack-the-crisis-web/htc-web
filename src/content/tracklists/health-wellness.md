      Systems that allow to prioritize testing and vaccination action to
      maximise the greater good. Solutions should be science-based and empower
      targeted public health measures to reduce the risk of infection help track

      Main problem regarding to public health is social distancing. Its
      important to make sure that people don´t get closer than 2 meters. On the
      other hand being indoor 24/7 is not good for health also. Possible
      solution an app that measures movement and distance between people.

      Many medical appointments and surgeries (that do not require immediate
      attention) are being postponed due to Covid-19 and new appointments are
      made only when there is utmost necessity. Some appointments are conducted
      over telephone or video-calls, but many of them are being postponed to an
      unknown future.\

      How to reorganize the appointments so that people can get the help they
      need on time and have timely information about what to expect; How could
      we: reorganise the appointments; in what order should the appointments
      take place; assess the criticality of the appointments; cancel/postpone
      the appointments where there is no longer a necessity to see the doctor;
      make best use of doctors’ time; keep people in the loop of what is
      happening?

      There are people who are vulnerable to pandemics - the immuno compromised
      folks with heart disease, diabetes, etc. How can we identify the medical
      needs by geography to effectively manage our supply chains during a
      crisis?A form like registry website that allows people to register
      themselves during a crisis - data columns - name or nick name, email
      address, postal code, medical condition, top 3 drugs/ medications needed
      to sustain good health

## Why Health & Wellness?

We are facing, first and foremost, a health crisis that will have a lasting impact and necessitate a vibrant health tech sector. Every death is a tragedy and every serious illness is a cause for serious concern, no matter the cause. However, this virus also has the potential to overwhelm our healthcare systems and reduce access to regular treatments, jeopardising public health on an even larger scale.

Through this crisis and beyond, both people and organisations will be thinking about the health of themselves and others in new ways and they will need new technology to support this. How can this result in a lasting long term positive impact?
