**Technology can also transform the public sector although the pace of change has so far lagged much further behind that of the private sector. Technology by itself is neither good nor bad in a political sense. Advancements in technology can be used for the empowerment of citizens, as well as their repression. Itâ€™s also important to understand that technology is not neutral. It changes the political landscape and has far reaching, often unintended consequences. One concern has been that online solutions could stop working, which could have disastrous effects for how we govern. For the first time though, we have realised during this pandemic that offline solutions can also stop working and sometimes digital is our only alternative. This pandemic is therefore likely to accelerate the pace of change in govtech, which provides an opportunity for smarter solutions to radically improve democracy, trust and transparency. To achieve this, we will need not just innovations in technology, which may already exist anyway, but also innovations in administrative processes and legal frameworks. We must also not lose sight of our values.**
