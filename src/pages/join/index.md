      On 14â€“15 March something spectacular started in Estonia. It took fewer
      than six hours for AccelerateEstonia, Garage48, and Guaana to put together
      an online hackathon to tackle the devastating effects of the Coronavirus
      crisis. 


      More than 1200 people across 14 time zones joined this effort and the
      world took notice. Now there are almost 30 initiatives around the globe
      hacking away, from India to Georgia to Brazil.
