  - title: Swedbank challenge
    description: >-
      Various businesses have put their operations on hold, more and more people
      are out of work, while there are businesses that now face skyrocketing
      demand for their goods and services and cannot keep up. Such industries as
      event, tourism, media, avio, catering have to fight extinction, while
      others thrive. 


      Think, for instance, about how to fix this structural imbalance, how to
      boost those businesses thriving and support those barely surviving. How to
      approach the rapidly increasing unemployment rate in both short and long
      term, how to mobilize the talented and bright minds now out of work. How
      to take advantage of the banking and fintech solutions out there to fight
      the crisis or what new solutions are needed now. What online tools or
      platforms can be part of the solution and what new framework of
      cooperation and partnerships would work best?

      Tourism companies, especially the smaller ones, in the present state of
      emergency situation, are suffering economic losses, because their direct
      source of income is the service consumers, both domestic and foreign
      tourists, who are not allowed to travel until unknown time. Tourism
      companies need immediately and quickly rethink their business model and
      use the existing situation to offer a different kind and innovative
      service, that usually is not their core business. Read more about the

      After the economic crisis of 2008, there was a dramatic rise in young
      people's (16-26 years old) unemployment rates. We should be better
      prepared to deal with possible similar consequences after COVID-19. We are
      looking for a proactive solution to manage possible risks rising from the
      economic repercussions of the virus. In addition, the solution could
      support the community by linking the unemployed youth and community
      problems/shortcomings.

      Due to the spread of COVID-19 and the need to abstain from physical
      contact, we among many countries have been forced to shut down victim
      offender mediation and other restorative justice services.It is troubling
      to see rise as well as transformation of conflicts in communities,
      families and among juveniles while being unable to provide mediation
      services due to the isolation requirements. The solution we are looking
      for, should enable us to create a safe and functioning online environment
      that is easy to access, enables identification, does not require
      high-level IT skills and provides protection of personal data and online
      security.

      COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on society in terms of health,
      emergency response, and economy. As the number of cases rises, the
      countries started to implement unprecedented measures such as lock-down
      their cities and stay-home order. Those policies surely save lives.
      However, the economic disturbance due to COIVD-19 and related policies
      might affect people’s lives just as much as any other financial crisis.
      The challenges are more hazardous in the countries where their economies
      are not formalized, guaranteed, and not publicly recognized/supported.


      The most vulnerable to the economic challenges due to the COVID-19 are
      those who have been working in the informal sector or those with a
      disability, sickness, and old age. Hence, several national governments
      have already announced their social protection measures, such as cash
      transfer programs to mitigate the risk associated with COVID-19. Though
      the success of cash transfer is critical to saving vulnerable people from
      economic severity, the cash transfer program, especially in developing
      countries, have several challenges:


       No effective ways to transfer cash to those in need\

       No accurate governmental data on the locations/names of those in need\

       In many cases, they are not up to date


      There is a significant risk of exclusion/inclusion error, due to the lack
      of accessible service and problems with transparency of policy
      implementation:


       No effective ways to communicate with those in need\

       Those people tend to have no access to an information source such as
      internet


      The situation requires solutions using technologies such as:


       Mobile payment solutions to obtain cash from local organizations such as
      bank\

       Biometrics identifications to maximize the effectiveness of the cash
      transfer\

       Integrating the several governmental databases to update the
      beneficiaries’ status\

       Use of ML model to minimize the exclusion/inclusion error and establish
      objective decision-making process for recipients\

       Big data analysis using data from the public such as national/local
      governments and private organization\

       Use of drone or robots to promote cash transfer program to those who
      need it avoiding physical interaction of people


      The World Bank team has been supporting the government in identifying the
      right and cost-efficient technologies that solve the delivery problems.
      However, the urgency of the issue requires more agile and creative
      solutions to address the challenges described above.

## Why economy?

We are facing a severe economic crisis like no other as traditional methods for stimulating the economy don’t work under lockdown. This is already having immediate economic consequences as we do not know how long this crisis will last and the impact is expected to last for a considerable time after that too. An economic crisis can also give birth to successful companies, and a national crisis can result in a completely new economic order for the better. What should we do to start adapting for this now?
