      data and services (Copernicus images, Galileo positioning), which can be a
      key enabler for many of the challenges.

      A system for sharing, in a secure and convenient way, trustworthy
      information about you relevant for the management of Covid-19 crisis. This
      trustworthy information would be digitally stored as credentials /
      attestations issued to you by the authorities responsible for accrediting
      its validity and veracity. For example, this system would serve to prove
      to your HR department that you have gone through the disease and cannot
      infect other people, and therefore you can be sent back to work, by means
      of an attestation given to you by your hospital, or to justify in front of
      a policeman that you have not respected the confinement because you are
      part of the essential workforce, by means of an attestation given to you
      by your company.

      In the COVID-19 crisis the most marginalized are not only more affected by
      the disease but are also more affected – socially and economically - by
      our (governance) responses to the pandemic. Call it the double injustice
      of COVID-19. 


      Questions for the public sector in this context are i.a., how can we
      factor such inequalities into our responses and how can we increase the
      transparency of our responses in terms of their equity and distributional
      effects?


      We hope that through our GlobalHack challenge, we will find partners,
      innovative solutions and resources for the creation of new platforms and
      citizens engagement tools that will help feeding real-time data about
      equity dimensions of policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis.

      COVID-19 outbreak creates a huge burden on the health system. The
      challenge is to organise and optimise the testing of infections. New
      testing methods and tools are emerging. How can we get the full benefits
      from new tests, how can we guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the
      tests and how can we evaluate and optimise our testing strategies?

      One challenge during the outbreak is to organise the health care.
      Preliminary data from the EU/EEA (from the countries with available data)
      show that around 20-30% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are hospitalised and
      4% have severe illness. Hospitalisation rates are higher for those aged 60
      years and above, and for those with other underlying health conditions.
      How can we reduce the burden in health care? How can we focus the
      re-sources to achieve best outcome? How can we target the control
      measures? ECDC maintains risk assessments which are available on the web
      site.

      Everyone is currently locked down in his apartment and a lot of
      administrative procedures need the presence of the user. This heavily
      contributes to the system' block. How might we exploit new technologies to
      ensure data security without the need of original paper documents?

## Why Crisis Response?

Medical workers and other emergency response personnel will be on the frontline of this pandemic, although many others will be working behind the scenes to support them, and every single person has a duty to help them by preventing the spread of the virus.

This is not a drill, but it will test us all to the extreme. How do we help those who help us and what lessons can we all take forward for the next crisis?



Track is brought to you by Hack the Crisis - India, Ficci Flo Pune in association with Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India (MEITY), MEITY Startup Hub (MSH), Make in India, MyGov, technology+startup hubs community, executed by Payal Rajpal(Founder [HackA​Cause](http://www.hackacause.in/page5.html)) & Gayatri Chhabria(Trustee [MMF](https://www.mmpc.in/who-we-are.html))the same forces which executed **Hack the Crisis – India,** are now leading the popular tracks of (Crisis + Health Wellness) at Global Hack.

While no one can control a pandemic, we can have collective impact as a nation from finding solutions to COVID19 and revival measures post-crisis.
