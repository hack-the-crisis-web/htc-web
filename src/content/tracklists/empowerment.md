A large proportion of our planet has been lifted out of poverty over recent decades, largely thanks to new opportunities from trade and technology. Yet we still live in a world of vast inequalities. This pandemic will affect everyone on Earth, but some will be negatively impacted more than others, especially those who are already among the poorest and most vulnerable. 

One particular area of concern affects the safety of women. Lockdown measures are predicted to result in a rise in domestic violence, which will be made worse by the fact that there may be less opportunities to find safety and authorities may have less resources to help.How can we come together through this crisis and achieve greater equality and access to opportunities instead?
