    textContent: >-
      On 14–15 March something spectacular started in Estonia. It took fewer
      than six hours for AccelerateEstonia, Garage48, and Guaana to put together
      an online hackathon to tackle the devastating effects of the Coronavirus
      crisis. 


      More than 1200 people across 14 time zones joined this effort and the
      world took notice. Now there are almost 30 initiatives around the globe
      hacking away, from India to Georgia to Brazil.

      How will we deal with the changed relationships in the economy, the future
      of work, healthcare and a world transformed, perhaps, beyond recognition? 


      We need to come up with solutions that will help us fight future
      pandemics, and all crises for that matter, more effectively. So we never
      have to lock down again.
