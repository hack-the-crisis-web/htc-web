      Systems that allow to prioritize testing and vaccination action to
      maximise the greater good. Solutions should be science-based and empower
      targeted public health measures to reduce the risk of infection help track
      the chains of infections quickly.

      Main problem regarding to public health is social distancing. Its
      important to make sure that people don´t get closer than 2 meters. On the
      other hand being indoor 24/7 is not good for health also. Possible
      solution an app that measures movement and distance between people.

      Many medical appointments and surgeries (that do not require immediate
      attention) are being postponed due to Covid-19 and new appointments are
      made only when there is utmost necessity. Some appointments are conducted
      over telephone or video-calls, but many of them are being postponed to an
      unknown future.\

      How to reorganize the appointments so that people can get the help they
      need on time and have timely information about what to expect; How could
      we: reorganise the appointments; in what order should the appointments
      take place; assess the criticality of the appointments; cancel/postpone
      the appointments where there is no longer a necessity to see the doctor;
      make best use of doctors’ time; keep people in the loop of what is
      happening?

      There are people who are vulnerable to pandemics - the immuno compromised
      folks with heart disease, diabetes, etc. How can we identify the medical
      needs by geography to effectively manage our supply chains during a
      crisis?A form like registry website that allows people to register
      themselves during a crisis - data columns - name or nick name, email
      address, postal code, medical condition, top 3 drugs/ medications needed
      to sustain good health

      People feel helpless and uncertain in the COVID outbreak. There is a huge
      need for up to date information about the outbreak. How can the citizen
      get latest reliable information about the situation globally, in Europe,
      in my country and in my neighbourhood? What is my risk to get ill right
      now in my neighbourhood? How can I reduce the risk to get an infection?

      COVID-19 is a new virus and there is only limited understanding of the
      disease, symptoms and cure. The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via
      small respiratory droplets through sneezing, coughing, or when people
      interact with each other for some time in close proximity (usually less
      than one metre). Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity from having no
      symptoms at all (being asymptomatic) to having fever, cough, sore throat,
      general weakness and fatigue and muscular pain and in the most severe
      cases, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and
      septic shock, all potentially leading to death. Reports show that clinical
      deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease.
      The infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear,
      but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even
      if symptoms are mild and very non-specific. The infectious period is now
      estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on
      average in severe cases. If the citizen is not feeling well, then how he
      can verify the symptoms and get medical consultation? How can be keep
      track of the infected people?

      Social distancing and new “work from home” lifestyles have confined
      billions around the world to their homes. Many have gained time from
      commutes, work commitments and recreational activities, but are challenged
      with spending that time practicing healthy habits, maintaining active
      routines and keeping from going stir crazy. We challenge you explore how
      music can be used to promote health and wellness in the “stay at home” era
      of COVID-19?

      Public health measures adopted for reducing the impact of COVID-19 include
      severe limitations of people movement and social contacts. It is difficult
      to adhere to these recommendations for very long times. The rules and
      prevention measures change when the epidemic proceeds. How can the citizen
      get the latest instructions (valid for the location) and how to support
      him to act accordingly?

## Why Health & Wellness?

We are facing, first and foremost, a health crisis that will have a lasting impact and necessitate a vibrant health tech sector. Every death is a tragedy and every serious illness is a cause for serious concern, no matter the cause. However, this virus also has the potential to overwhelm our healthcare systems and reduce access to regular treatments, jeopardising public health on an even larger scale.

Through this crisis and beyond, both people and organisations will be thinking about the health of themselves and others in new ways and they will need new technology to support this. How can this result in a lasting long term positive impact?

Track is brought to you by Hack the Crisis - India, Ficci Flo Pune in association with Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, Government of India (MEITY), MEITY Startup Hub (MSH), Make in India, MyGov, technology+startup hubs community, executed by Payal Rajpal(Founder [HackA​Cause](http://www.hackacause.in/page5.html)) & Gayatri Chhabria(Trustee [MMF](https://www.mmpc.in/who-we-are.html))the same forces which executed **Hack the Crisis – India,** are now leading the popular tracks of (Crisis + Health Wellness) at Global Hack.

While no one can control a pandemic, we can have collective impact as a nation from finding solutions to COVID19 and revival measures post-crisis.
