      6 trillion cigarettes are smoked annually out of which 4,5 trillion butts
      end up in nature every year. As cigarette butts are small and don't seem
      harmful, they are too often littered. Cigarette butts take up to 15 years
      to degrade in the environment and killing living beings. How we can clean
      up all the cigarette butts from nature after COVID-19 as there is a threat
      that butts are infected with virus. How we avoid cigarette butts to end up
      in nature?

      The current crisis offers us a great opportunity to re-think our social
      and economic systems.\

      Coronavirus comes together with deep economic crisis. As governments,
      businesses and people are focused on crises and how to deal with its
      consequences, the environmental topic is most probably the subject to
      postpone. This can lead us even to greater economic crises that comes from
      climate change that is speeding up due to pressure to economic growth.
      Failure in climate change mitigation could lead to greater human life and
      economic losses.\

      How we can use the model how we fight with coronavirus to tackle the
      environmental challenges? The world needs to demonstrate the same unity
      and commitment to climate action and cutting greenhouse gas emissions as
      to containing the Coronavirus pandemic.\

      The Covid-19 pandemic has unleashed humanity’s instinct to transform
      itself in the face of a universal threat and it can help us do the same to
      create a livable planet for future generations.\

      On an individual level how we can re-organise our activities to benefit
      the environment? How the governments can use the economic stimulus
      packages as a tool to catalyze the transformation to restorative and
      sustainable society?\

      How to help businesses quikly find a circular economy models as the way to
      restore their businesses.

## **Why Environment?**

**Before this coronavirus crisis began, our planet was already in a climate crisis – although with less consensus about the urgency of the issue and less cooperation aimed at solving it.**

**Now, measures to combat coronavirus have unintentionally helped our environment as pollution has reduced dramatically. Will our planet return to its previous ways after this crisis or will we discover a new appreciation for our temporarily cleaner world, as well as new ideas to work together to clean it up even more?**
