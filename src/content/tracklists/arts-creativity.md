## **Why Arts & Creativity?**

**Itâ€™s difficult to value art and creativity in the best of times, but especially alongside an issue that involves loss of life, the most valuable thing of all. But art in its many different forms from music to comedy, is essential for helping us find meaning, beauty and comfort in this world.**

**This crisis poses serious new challenges to creatives as less people are able to visit their work and funding from both public and private sources will be strained for the foreseeable future. The world needs art now more than ever though so how do we solve this?**
