  The Global Hack is an online hackathon designed to share and rapidly develop
  ideas for urgently needed solutions in the face of the current crisis, as well
  as to build resilience post-pandemic.

  The Global Hack has already drawn attention across the globe - covered by
  Forbes, Silicon Republic, GovInsider among others - and brought on board a
  fleet of world-class mentors, such as Silicon Valley’s tech superstar Steve
  Jurvetson, former President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Khaliya - 
  public health specialist and a neuro-technologist.

  The tracks are inspired by the UN sustainability goals that cover the majority
  of our future challenges. These are the areas most likely to see the biggest
  challenges.

      The Global Hack is a global initiative which unites the Hack the Crisis
      movement and the 40+ hackathons organized in the frames of this movement.
      The core initiative comes from the team who organized the very first
      hackathon just in 6 hours on 13-15 of March in Estonia and are passionate
      about solving the huge ongoing crisis that concerns everyone at the moment
      (the people are from Garage48, Accelerate Estonia, Guaana). BUT this is
      truly a global effort and movement involving communities and organizers
      from all over the world.

    textContent: >-
      How will we deal with the changed relationships in the economy, the future
      of work, healthcare and a world transformed, perhaps, beyond recognition? 


      We need to come up with solutions that will help us fight future
      pandemics, and all crises for that matter, more effectively. So we never
      have to lock down again.
