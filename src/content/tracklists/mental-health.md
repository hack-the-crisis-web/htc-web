      Studies have shown that too much free time for youngsters can lead to self
      harm, risk behaviour and victimization. During times of crises when direct
      social inerraction and mobilty is limited, how do we keep our young
      generation (13-19 years old) safe and meaningfully active? We need a
      community based solution that will help engage young people in to
      acitivites that will empower the youth and strenghten the local community.

## Why Mental Health?

A sudden change in circumstances can be mentally challenging, whether it’s losing a loved one, a job or even just political upheaval. All these factors combine in this crisis in ways that most of us have never seen during our lifetimes. In addition, relationships will be put under considerable pressure and many will be lonelier than ever before, which is one of the most significant contributing factors to ill mental health.

However, it’s ok not to be ok at any time, not just during this crisis, and this affects all of us. Mental health challenges are far less visible than physical health challenges, but they are just as important and just as deserving of solutions. If we can surge healthcare capacity to fight the virus then how can we make a similar effort to improve mental health.
