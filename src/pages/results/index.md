            Though the total usage of internet-streaming services has surged by
            between 50% and 70%, starting from January 2020, most of the popular
            platforms are still hard to monetize as they do not offer pay per
            view option and their links are easily sharable.

            Pandemic made travel almost impossible, and for people from risk
            groups, such as 50+, it will probably be still hard to travel for an
            extended period of time even after the situation normalizes. As a
            tourism expert, I expect that tourism activities have a dramatic
            decrease on the long run.

            We hope to solve the aforementioned video communication issues in
            communities that are larger than 5 and smaller than 25. That is, we
            want to make it easy to reach out to your peers and to collaborate
            more organically.

            With lockdown, the performing arts are suffering from the lack of
            direct contact and "energy transfer" between performers and
            audience. We are creating a platform where audience is visible to
            the artist and to each-other, much like on the real venue at the
            event or festival, by turning their webcams on and allowing
            elektron.live capture the pictures of the spectators.

            Art is fundamental in the daily life, yet it became kind of luxury
            being sold by galleries. It is not widely accessible as it could be.
            Young artists on the other hand struggle with getting presented by
            galleries, so they have to promote their art with Instagram and
            other socials. There is no way people can "try" the art before
            buying it.

            We hope to reduce the spread of misinformation specifically about
            the spread, treatments of Covid-19 which is potentially more harmful
            than the virus itself. There have been so many cases of needless
            death all of which could be prevented by the right information
            delivered in a manner that reaches across different age groups

            We're thinking beyond COVID-19 pandemic, so we built an Airbnb-like
            platform to book artists globally via live streaming. Imagine
            getting Richard Marx, Mariah Carey, Ed Sheeran to perform at your
            birthday party, virtually!
