      The Global Hack is a global initiative which unites the Hack the Crisis
      movement and the 40+ hackathons organized in the frames of this movement.
      This is truly a global effort and movement involving communities and
      organizers from all over the world.

      We have partnered with UN, New America, World Food and more to support the
      message of finding solutions.

    textContent: >-
      How will we deal with the changing relationships in the economy, the
      future of work, healthcare and a world transformed, perhaps, beyond
      recognition?  We need to come up with solutions that will help us fight
      future pandemics, and all crises for that matter, more effectively. 


      We're giving away 195 000€ (and growing) to make your amazing ideas to
      come true.
