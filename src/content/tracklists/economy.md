      There will be significant impacts on those sectors reliant on
      discretionary consumer spending. This applies to the non-food retail
      sector, already facing major structural challenges, and to leisure and
      hospitality. Although relatively small in absolute employment numbers,
      Kent has a large and productive agricultural sector, reliant on a seasonal
      (and to a large extent migrant) workforce. While demand for food is
      resilient, social distancing measures and reduced migration could impose
      significant supply shocks on the industry.How can these sectors be
      protected? How will the future of these sectors look? What policy changes
      will help? Can there be a PPP model that is effective?

      Emergency: Kent is the Garden of England, its fruit and salads help to
      feed the country. Kent alone needs up 7,500 workers on the fields. How can
      this be achieved.\

      Recovery: We don’t know when, but do know for certain that we will emerge
      from the coronavirus crisis. When we do, our local Recovery Plan must be
      ready to roll. As the most successful inward investment agency nationally,
      Locate in Kent has a major role to play – but what should it be?\

      Sustainability: What is the new normal for Kent?
  - title: Swedbank challenge
    description: >-
      Various businesses have put their operations on hold, more and more people
      are out of work, while there are businesses that now face skyrocketing
      demand for their goods and services and cannot keep up. Such industries as
      event, tourism, media, avio, catering have to fight extinction, while
      others thrive. 


      Think, for instance, about how to fix this structural imbalance, how to
      boost those businesses thriving and support those barely surviving. How to
      approach the rapidly increasing unemployment rate in both short and long
      term, how to mobilize the talented and bright minds now out of work. How
      to take advantage of the banking and fintech solutions out there to fight
      the crisis or what new solutions are needed now. What online tools or
      platforms can be part of the solution and what new framework of
      cooperation and partnerships would work best?

      Tourism companies, especially the smaller ones, in the present state of
      emergency situation, are suffering economic losses, because their direct
      source of income is the service consumers, both domestic and foreign
      tourists, who are not allowed to travel until unknown time. Tourism
      companies need immediately and quickly rethink their business model and
      use the existing situation to offer a different kind and innovative
      service, that usually is not their core business. Read more about the

      After the economic crisis of 2008, there was a dramatic rise in young
      people's (16-26 years old) unemployment rates. We should be better
      prepared to deal with possible similar consequences after COVID-19. We are
      looking for a proactive solution to manage possible risks rising from the
      economic repercussions of the virus. In addition, the solution could
      support the community by linking the unemployed youth and community
      problems/shortcomings.

      Due to the spread of COVID-19 and the need to abstain from physical
      contact, we among many countries have been forced to shut down victim
      offender mediation and other restorative justice services.It is troubling
      to see rise as well as transformation of conflicts in communities,
      families and among juveniles while being unable to provide mediation
      services due to the isolation requirements. The solution we are looking
      for, should enable us to create a safe and functioning online environment
      that is easy to access, enables identification, does not require
      high-level IT skills and provides protection of personal data and online
      security.

      COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on society in terms of health,
      emergency response, and economy. As the number of cases rises, the
      countries started to implement unprecedented measures such as lock-down
      their cities and stay-home order. Those policies surely save lives.
      However, the economic disturbance due to COIVD-19 and related policies
      might affect people’s lives just as much as any other financial crisis.
      The challenges are more hazardous in the countries where their economies
      are not formalized, guaranteed, and not publicly recognized/supported.


      The most vulnerable to the economic challenges due to the COVID-19 are
      those who have been working in the informal sector or those with a
      disability, sickness, and old age. Hence, several national governments
      have already announced their social protection measures, such as cash
      transfer programs to mitigate the risk associated with COVID-19. Though
      the success of cash transfer is critical to saving vulnerable people from
      economic severity, the cash transfer program, especially in developing
      countries, have several challenges:


       No effective ways to transfer cash to those in need\

       No accurate governmental data on the locations/names of those in need\

       In many cases, they are not up to date


      There is a significant risk of exclusion/inclusion error, due to the lack
      of accessible service and problems with transparency of policy
      implementation:


       No effective ways to communicate with those in need\

       Those people tend to have no access to an information source such as
      internet


      The situation requires solutions using technologies such as:


       Mobile payment solutions to obtain cash from local organizations such as
      bank\

       Biometrics identifications to maximize the effectiveness of the cash
      transfer\

       Integrating the several governmental databases to update the
      beneficiaries’ status\

       Use of ML model to minimize the exclusion/inclusion error and establish
      objective decision-making process for recipients\

       Big data analysis using data from the public such as national/local
      governments and private organization\

       Use of drone or robots to promote cash transfer program to those who
      need it avoiding physical interaction of people


      The World Bank team has been supporting the government in identifying the
      right and cost-efficient technologies that solve the delivery problems.
      However, the urgency of the issue requires more agile and creative
      solutions to address the challenges described above.

      While the virus is having a halting effect on our lives, it has none on
      the seasons. Spring has reached the Northern hemisphere marking the
      beginning of a busy season in agriculture – a period where hiring in large
      numbers is an absolute necessity.\

      \

      The share of immigrant labour among both skilled and seasonal workforce in
      this sector is a well-know secret in most parts of the world. Many workers
      left during the outbreak of the crises, but most were just getting ready
      to come. Except that now, borders are closed, and ironically, national
      food security now falls on the shoulders of locals – those who have never
      had any interest and lack skills to take on this line of work.\

      \

      At the same time, unemployment is on the rise in many other sectors,
      figures on payslips are diminishing and workers are forced to accept
      unpaid vacations for the unseen future. How to bridge these problems? How
      to get locals with reduced working hours to contribute to this season’s
      harvest and our local food supply?

      European Solidarity Voucher to ensure liquidity of SMEs in the EU’s
      tourism sector

    description: >-
      The European Solidarity Vouchers (voucher) Scheme incentives customers to
      buy services from suppliers in the tourism sector and consume the services
      after the crisis. Under the scheme customers would buy vouchers (for a
      small hotel or B&B, or restaurant) via existing aggregator platforms.\

      \

      An emphasis of the solidarity scheme is that all actors are coming
      together to support small businesses. The suggestion is that the online
      platforms (i.e. booking.com; expedia.com, etc.) would be willing to waive
      some of their booking fees based on the motivation of demonstrate
      solidarity with small businesses. Second, the SMEs themselves would offer
      discounts (10-15%) to costumers to provide them with incentives to
      purchase the vouchers. Finally, the consumers would make a critical
      contribution to finance the SMEs and micro-businesses through the purchase
      of the solidarity vouchers, knowing that they won’t be able to use the
      vouchers for the next couple of weeks or even months.

## Why economy?

We are facing a severe economic crisis like no other as traditional methods for stimulating the economy don’t work under lockdown. This is already having immediate economic consequences as we do not know how long this crisis will last and the impact is expected to last for a considerable time after that too.
