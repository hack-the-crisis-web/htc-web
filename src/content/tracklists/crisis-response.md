      data and services (Copernicus images, Galileo positioning), which can be a

      A system for sharing, in a secure and convenient way, trustworthy
      information about you relevant for the management of Covid-19 crisis. This
      trustworthy information would be digitally stored as credentials /
      attestations issued to you by the authorities responsible for accrediting
      its validity and veracity. For example, this system would serve to prove
      to your HR department that you have gone through the disease and cannot
      infect other people, and therefore you can be sent back to work, by means
      of an attestation given to you by your hospital, or to justify in front of
      a policeman that you have not respected the confinement because you are
      part of the essential workforce, by means of an attestation given to you
      by your company.

## Why Crisis Response?

Medical workers and other emergency response personnel will be on the frontline of this pandemic, although many others will be working behind the scenes to support them, and every single person has a duty to help them by preventing the spread of the virus.

This is not a drill, but it will test us all to the extreme. How do we help those who help us and what lessons can we all take forward for the next crisis?
