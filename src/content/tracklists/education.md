      Starting next school year, Latvian schools will be implementing a newly
      developed curriculum, emphasizing meaningful learning, lifelong learning
      skills. This means greater emphasis on clear learning goals for students,
      timely and developmental feedback, self-monitoring and reflection on what
      is being learned and what must be improved. Latvian schools - pupils and
      teachers - need a set of integrated tools, where teachers can monitor
      student progress against clear learning goals, students can follow their
      own growth and submit evidence of learning, students of different ages and
      stages can create portfolios of their work, reflect on it, select their
      best pieces, choose to make them visible to peers and teachers for
      feedback, in other words - simple, straightforward tools that help make
      learning visible to everyone involved.

      Shutting down schools has caused an enormous burden on teachers, students,
      and schools, as well as parents who have to find means to support
      home-schooling. Parents with full-time jobs need to find solutions to stay
      professional and focus on their job, while at the same time supporting and
      explaining homework for their children. Teachers don’t have a unified
      system to which they can all be easily on-boarded, many of them using Zoom
      or other video tools for the first time in their lives. Students struggle
      with lack of explanations and unified platforms to submit all their
      homework in one place. There are families who lack the technology or
      equipment to support all their children at once, and there is no risk-free
      environment to manage the supply for the demand. Let’s join forces to
      develop tools for teachers and students that are effective and easy to use
      during this new normal.

      In light of the current pandemic, the main challenge students and parents
      are facing is being able to effectively access educational material on the
      internet. This is an issue due to expensive internet subscription costs
      paired with a loss of jobs and/or pay cuts.\

      Most parents are more concerned about feeding their families as a priority
      - meaning amenities like internet access is dropped. With mobile adoption
      still high, how are we able to leverage mobile-first education so that
      more children can continue their education remotely?

## Why Education?

Few things have had a more powerfully positive impact on our planet than improved access to education. However, classrooms around the world have suddenly been locked shut and teachers are urgently rethinking how to teach effectively.

The impact of this ranges from slight inconvenience in digitally connected countries to complete interruption of education in many other parts of the world. There are also many challenging consequences, including an increase in hunger among pupils who depended on school meals and an added burden on parents.

Work track of The Global Hack is led by the Team who were behind “[Hack for Italy](http://hackforitaly.online/)”, a crisis response online hackathon in Italy that took place between March 27 and 29.\
Thanks to the international appeal, the team has now joined the forces with international communities from the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Italy.
