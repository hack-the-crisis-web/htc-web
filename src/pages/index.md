  The Global Hack is an online hackathon designed to share and rapidly develop
  ideas for urgently needed solutions in the face of the current crisis, as well
  as to build resilience post-pandemic.


  Our prize pool for the best ideas is 195k euros. 


  The Global Hack has already drawn attention across the globe - covered by
  Forbes, Silicon Republic, CNN among others - and brought on board a fleet of
  world-class mentors, such as Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, former President of
  Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Khaliya -  public health specialist and a
  neuro-technologist.

  challenges.

      The Global Hack is a global initiative which unites the Hack the Crisis
      movement and the 40+ hackathons organized in the frames of this movement.
      This is truly a global effort and movement involving communities and
      organizers from all over the world.

      We have partnered with UN, New America, World Food and more to support the
      message of finding solutions.

  - title: The Goal
    textContent: >-
      How will we deal with the changing relationships in the economy, the
      future of work, healthcare and a world transformed, perhaps, beyond
      recognition?  We need to come up with solutions that will help us fight
      future pandemics, and all crises for that matter, more effectively. 


      We're giving away 195 000€ (and growing) to make your amazing ideas to
      come true.
