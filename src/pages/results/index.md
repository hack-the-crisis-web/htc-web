            With lockdown, the performing arts are suffering from the lack of
            direct contact and "energy transfer" between performers and
            audience. We are creating a platform where audience is visible to
            the artist and to each-other, much like on the real venue at the
            event or festival, by turning their webcams on and allowing
            elektron.live capture the pictures of the spectators.
