      6 trillion cigarettes are smoked annually out of which 4,5 trillion butts
      end up in nature every year. As cigarette butts are small and don't seem
      harmful, they are too often littered. Cigarette butts take up to 15 years
      to degrade in the environment and killing living beings. How we can clean
      up all the cigarette butts from nature after COVID-19 as there is a threat
      that butts are infected with virus. How we avoid cigarette butts to end up
      in nature?

## **Why Environment?**

**Before this coronavirus crisis began, our planet was already in a climate crisis â€“ although with less consensus about the urgency of the issue and less cooperation aimed at solving it.**

**Now, measures to combat coronavirus have unintentionally helped our environment as pollution has reduced dramatically. Will our planet return to its previous ways after this crisis or will we discover a new appreciation for our temporarily cleaner world, as well as new ideas to work together to clean it up even more?**
