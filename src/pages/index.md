      March 14 and 15 something spectacular happened. In less than 6 hours
      AccelerateEstonia and Garage48 put together an online hackathon to tackle
      the effects of the Coronavirus crisis. More than a thousand people across
      14 time zones joined, and out of the 30 or so ideas, several are already
      up and running!


      The world took notice. Now there are almost 30 initiatives around the
      globe hacking away, from India to Georgia to Brazil. Thereâ€™s been a
      massive ripple effect (exponential growth, if you pardon the
      epidemiological parlance), which proves that if there ever was a time to
      make things bigger, then this is it!
