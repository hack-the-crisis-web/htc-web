      In the current corona-crisis many societal stakeholders like citizens,
      local communities, schools, universities, companies, civil society
      organizations etc. recognise that they have valuable resources to
      contribute to an effective, equitable and sustainable response to the
      crisis.\

      \

      But there is a lack of coordination and innovation capacity among existing
      public institutions on local, national and international level – the
      natural leaders for public good delivery collaboration.\

      \

      This local and global multistakeholder engagement gap is the focus of the
      present #GloCha challenge – a global public sector innovation initiative.

      Public health agencies are dealing with outbreak with the means they have
      like collecting information, assessing the situation, communication to the
      public and even forcing restrictions. Countries have made different
      measure to reduce physical contact between people and in this way limit
      the spreading of the virus. How can the decision makers compare different
      options?

      Even during the outbreak, we should have reliable scientific evidence for
      the preventive actions. How can we do research faster without sacrificing
      credibility? What is needed for rapid scientific research? In the short
      and long run, we need to base the views and recommendations on data. How
      can we collect valid and complete data sets in real time?\

## Why governance?

Technology by itself is neither good nor bad in a political sense. Advancements in technology can be used for the empowerment of citizens, as well as their repression. It’s also important to understand that technology is not neutral. It changes the political landscape and has far reaching, often unintended consequences. One concern has been that online solutions could stop working, which could have disastrous effects for how we govern. For the first time though, we have realised during this pandemic that offline solutions can also stop working and sometimes digital is our only alternative. This pandemic is therefore likely to accelerate the pace of change in govtech, which provides an opportunity for smarter solutions to radically improve democracy, trust and transparency. To achieve this, we will need not just innovations in technology, which may already exist anyway, but also innovations in administrative processes and legal frameworks. We must also not lose sight of our values.
