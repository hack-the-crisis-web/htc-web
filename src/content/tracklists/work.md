      The whole world is sitting at home. On the one hand, it is an opportunity
      to have a well-earned rest and spend valuable time with your family. On
      the other hand, this situation might complicate quickly as quarantine
      could easily last for longer than a few months. What should these people
      do then?\

      \

      “ChangeMakers’ON” invites you to accept the challenge and solve the
      problem of unemployment in Lithuania. Spending more time at home can bring
      new opportunities and ideas on how one can earn very much needed
      internet-enabled income. This is especially important for those, who lost
      their jobs and are not just on temporary remote work or holidays. Do you
      have any ideas how they can survive? How everybody can enable the virtual
      world not only for calls with friends but also to create a new business
      and a new source of income? These solutions are now inevitable in order to
      prevent or contain the spread of COVID-19. The teams with the most
      feasible ideas will have the opportunity to take advantage of the \

      “ChangeMakers‘ON“ accelerator: to have individual consultations and get
      funding to buy needed equipment for a new workplace.

## Why Work?

Organisations of all types and sizes have been forced to adapt during the crisis, largely by embracing remote work through technology and new processes. This is considerably easier for some than others, however.

It’s possible that many of the temporary changes during this period will become the new normal and remain permanently as their benefits are appreciated. How can we help this adaption for companies of varying types through the crisis and beyond?

Work track of The Global Hack is led by the Team who were behind “[Hack for Italy](http://hackforitaly.online/)”, a crisis response online hackathon in Italy that took place between March 27 and 29.\
Thanks to the international appeal, the team has now joined the forces with international communities from the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Italy.
