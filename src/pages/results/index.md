      The disinfection station will provide a holistic solution for a hygiene
      method as a global standard. By providing easy, affordable and
      barrier-free access to hand disinfection, we can help reduce the spread of
      viruses like corona, both within Europe and abroad. We achieve such
      extensive coverage by coupling UV lamps with our upcycled solar
      generators, allowing it to be a truly sustainable and inclusive solution
      that can be brought to exactly where it's needed.

      Before this crisis approx 12% of the world's population was in need of
      psychological support. There’re currently 3bln people in lockdown which
      means at least 360mln are experiencing strong emotional imbalance. Yet
      they don't have access to secure online emotional support which would fit
      their cultural background.

            Though the total usage of internet-streaming services has surged by
            between 50% and 70%, starting from January 2020, most of the popular
            platforms are still hard to monetize as they do not offer pay per

            Pandemic made travel almost impossible, and for people from risk

            Art is fundamental in the daily life, yet it became kind of luxury
            being sold by galleries. It is not widely accessible as it could be.
            Young artists on the other hand struggle with getting presented by
            galleries, so they have to promote their art with Instagram and
            other socials. There is no way people can "try" the art before
            buying it.

            Victims of Novel Corona virus develop acute respiratory failure and
            requires support of mechanical ventilation. Ventilators are highly
            expensive of about 4-5 lakhs. Conventional BVM bag compression which
            is low cost causes barotrauma, rupture of alveoli. The remote rural
            areas across the world are inaccessible to healthcare. Our idea is
            to create Low-cost, portable ventilator based on air-turbine for
            mass casualty cases with estimated cost of 10K Rs.

            Social Distancing Supervision System. We implied in our solution
            video processing to spot crowd density. An input real-life video is
            intoduced to our application from a crowded place to analyze and
            report the measured distance status between individuals. As a
            result, a real life feed of the camera with all neeeded distance
            calcultations is provided to the superviser. Add to that, we started

            When disaster strikes, it is common for a hospital or even a city to
            quickly become overwhelmed with patients, whereas the neighboring
            regions might have capacity. Even if the infrastructure and
            transport capacities are sufficient, the coordination is often very
            poor. The capability to build a detailed plan in advance would allow
            the load to be evenly distributed across a number of facilities,
            resulting in better individual care for the patients.

            As of March 16th, fifty percent of the world's kids are now in
            online school, where students are reluctant to participate and are
            often confused in class. The transition is just as hard for
            teachers, who struggle to understand if their lessons are absorbed
            by their students as they can barely see their faces and reactions.
            To solve this, we built InsideScoop—a platform that uses
            cutting-edge tools to personalize every student’s education by
            providing their teachers with real-time actionable reports on each
            student.

            sport event organisers and their client base, we engage millions of
            people fast. Through sport events as stress coping mechanism, we
            lower some of the problems that have arisen because of Covid-19.
            Through experimentation, design new way how we could look at sport
            event approach.

            During social isolation over the last weeks, I have observed many
            people in videoconferences constantly touching their faces, mostly
            subconsciously. This is a potential infection path for the virus,
            getting on a mucous membrane in your eyes, mouth or nose and enters
            your body. Our app nudges you away from this risky behavior by
            alerting you when your hand is close to your face.

            Currently only severe cases and medical workers are being tested. In
            the (near) future we will likely want to see exactly how many people
            were infected to see if we are getting close to herd immunity
            levels. By allowing people to test themselves in the comfort of
            their own home, we can get an overview of the entire population
            without stressing the healthcare system.
