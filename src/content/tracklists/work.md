## Why Work?

Organisations of all types and sizes have been forced to adapt during the crisis, largely by embracing remote work through technology and new processes. This is considerably easier for some than others, however.

It’s possible that many of the temporary changes during this period will become the new normal and remain permanently as their benefits are appreciated. How can we help this adaption for companies of varying types through the crisis and beyond?
